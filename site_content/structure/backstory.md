# Backstory

This work started in the UK MOD with some clear, albeit formidable, strategic direction:

Project CONCRETE (the capitalisation is an old military custom that pre-dates 'shouting') was born.  We all recognise the sentiment here; a gut feeling that we could do so much better. Yet it is difficult to pin down what causes this feeling, and hence, what we might do to correct it. Following some particularly wise advice, Project CONCRETE started to consider user needs, relentlessly asking the question 'Why?'.  Only later, armed with a much more thorough understanding of the user perspective did this work start to explore the technologies and processes that might enable those needs. As this involved digital security, this work was, and remains, entirely open.    

It is much easier to find something if you know what you are looking for. The technology search rapidly found many people in other government departments, academia, and industry working on technologies and approaches that could potentially solve core pieces of the puzzle. The new expanded (and now continuously expanding) team recognised that those needs were not unique to the MOD, but were generally held by all organisations, and society in general. 

It quickly became apparent that the act of 'sorting this out' would involve developing new digital foundations (this is not, and could not be, a product to buy). It would also require new services to be developed, and would lead to the continuous development of new tools to make use of these new foundations [^fst].  Having identified that one of the main barriers to interoperability and teamwork was caused by people taking isolated approaches, it made sense to seek to maximally share the development of those tools, standards, and services.  This is partly for the wider benefit of other government departments, industry, and society - but everyone gains from taking a collaborative approach.

Rather than talking in abstract terms, this project continues to use the UK and associated government departments for context and examples (in doing so, it talks about, but not for, the UK Government).

[^fst]:
    As a mental starting point: 'Foundations' are a technical configuration of a computer system and the associated socio- elements of how users will interact with it.  'Services' represent activities conducted by groups of people eg management of identities, time, or finance. 'Tools' are other pieces of software that make use of the foundations; these are what most users will actually work with on a day-to-day basis (forget what you have today - this will be new).
