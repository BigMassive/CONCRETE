# Overview

This is a collection of inter-related material for many people with different needs.  It is not really meant to be consumed linearly.  Unfortunately this makes it one-size-fits-none.  It is broadly organised into 3 high-level categories:

-   Socio-technical material about the 'foundation', associated ways of working, and services.  What is it? and How to use it?
-   The practical development path.  How do we make and maintain this?
-   Wider implications and viewpoints. How do we make the most our foundation? So-what?

Basic search is provided.

As a reminder, this is work-in-progress.  The first invitation is to request criticism. There are errors and mistakes here; please point them out in the Issues area at this link:

As a work-in-progress there are many places where it is important to highlight where work is required and/or to highlight the current perceived degree of certainty in an approach.  The following labels are used to portray this:

To-do
{: .label .label-blue }

Stable
{: .label .label-green }

Probable
{: .label .label-purple }

Speculative
{: .label .label-yellow }

Highly Speculative
{: .label .label-red }

Be careful though, just because something is labelled as <span>Stable</span>{: .label .label-green} does not mean that it is right.  Please remain alert and critical.
