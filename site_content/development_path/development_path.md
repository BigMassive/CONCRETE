Everyone's digital systems are highly 'stovepiped'.  These 'stovepipes' act as a massive drag on efficiency, effectiveness, collaboration, growth, and the quality of social discourse. They are caused by having digital systems that are based on fundamentally misaligned digital foundations (eg approaches to security and data).



CONCRETE analysis to date has produced a preliminary outline of the minimum socio-technical foundations (technical standards and how they are used) required to support all digital activities 



The UK needs to take a universally-scoped strategic approach to the development of digital standards and best practices. 





Needs to have leadership - Gov and international.

Never ending journey

## Desired End state

>Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company.  It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one.  It’s not about one simple software solution.  It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.

>Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft


The desired end state is to have the processes and organisational structures in place to enable the UK to make, maintain and exploit world-leading digital standards and associated best practices. User needs are being efficiently and effectively collated and communicated to a strong high-tech academic and industrial base. The implications for new technical/computing developments are being recognised and exploited to generate best-of-class capabilities.
