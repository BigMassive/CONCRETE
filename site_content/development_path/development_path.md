Getting started on the never-ending journey

Current digital standards (or our lack of them) are acting as a massive drag on efficiency, effectiveness, collaboration, growth, and the quality of social discourse. 

Cannot be developed by a company - requires Strategic leadership to National and international standards, best practices, tools, and services. Footnote international.

CONCRETE analysis to date has produced a preliminary outline of the minimum socio-technical foundations (technical standards and how they are used) required to support all digital activities 

Small/Tiny in government terms.


Live alongside current systems - people can add this into their own lives/organisations at their own pace.

Not a one-size-fits-all.  More of a pick and mix. Equally gov providing best-of-class.

Beware of: The only way is up. Yazz.  From this digital low, a move in any direction would be beneficial. This is not good enough.  

Coherently, brings together some technologies from different fields who have been calling on this for years/decades.  They can't get anywhere in today's environment.  It's not about choosing one of them.  We can simultaneously choose all of the above.  This is not to say that this foundation is perfect - indeed, this will be a never-ending journey.

Everyone (all depts) along for the journey - otherwise it'll just be another local stovepipe.

Highest common denominator.  Grew out of the MOD and security services.  

Bare minimum.

Foundation is small - and should get smaller and more trustworthy.  Prototypes are already being made.  Because - Yazz - possible to incrementally add stuff.

Needed by gov depts anyway.
Provide to society and humanity.


Tools should grow.

Acceleration.



Phase 0

Figure out the organisation - cross-departmental digital leadership is new.

Make the basic foundation using agile techniques

Agile - benefits start from approximately day 1.  Expect this to take a couple of years.

Anyone can take / use any bits at any time.

Services.



Phase 1

Exploit it for the good of society



Mission
To place UK digital development activities on a sustainable strategic footing.

Organisation

Foundation small number of people - perfective.  Should slow down.

Ready the workforce.

Agile


Start V2 straight away.  Don't ossify again.

## Desired End state

>Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company.  It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one.  It’s not about one simple software solution.  It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.

>Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft


The desired end state is to have the processes and organisational structures in place to enable the UK to make, maintain and exploit world-leading digital standards and associated best practices. User needs are being efficiently and effectively collated and communicated to a strong high-tech academic and industrial base. The implications for new technical/computing developments are being recognised and exploited to generate best-of-class capabilities.
