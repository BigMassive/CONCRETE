Getting started on the never-ending journey

Intro para.
The previous section - foundation and services considered user needs, digital foundations, services etc. Socio-technical engineering.  This section considers how to turn these into reality.  No previous exposure to digital development is assumed.  Nor is an understanding of what's in the foundation section.  In fact most people, including technologists, may have had little exposure to the sub-components.

This is not the only way to do this - but not leaving people in the lurch with a technical outline and a blank page.

## CONCRETE from a developmental perspective

Current digital standards (or our lack of them) are acting as a massive drag on efficiency, effectiveness, collaboration, growth, and the quality of social discourse. 
CONCRETE analysis to date has produced a preliminary outline of the minimum socio-technical foundations (technical standards and how they are used) required to support all digital activities 
technical foundations, support services, and tools.

Needed by gov depts anyway.
Provide to society and humanity.
security, data handling.

Cannot be developed by a company - requires Strategic leadership to National and international standards, best practices, tools, and services. Footnote international.
Expect to use companies to provide development services not products.  Engineers more like road building companies for govt infra projects, not 

Foundation is small/tiny - and should get smaller and more trustworthy. Bare minimum. Prototypes are already being made. 
This is not to say that this foundation is perfect - indeed, this will be a never-ending journey. Perfective - seeking the minimum change.
Want something that has been around the buoy a few times before it's let out.
Don't want to build things on shaky foundations.


Coherently, brings together some technologies from different fields who have been calling on this for years/decades.  They can't get anywhere in today's environment.  It's not about choosing one of them.  We can simultaneously choose all of the above. 
Beware of: The only way is up. Yazz.  From this digital low, a move in any direction would be beneficial. This is not good enough.  
Because - Yazz - possible to incrementally add stuff.

Not just about the technical development - need to do the socio and cultural - need to learn how to do this.

Want to understand the average user journey and to have lead examples.

Services - what scale - learn how to do this.

Contracting methods.

Roll-out. Live alongside current systems - people can add this into their own lives/organisations at their own pace.  Deliver standards, best practices etc, leave the exploitation to others.

Not a one-size-fits-all.  More of a pick and mix. Equally gov providing best-of-class.

## Phase 1

To place digital development activities on a firm, sustainable strategic footing.

Figure out the organisation - cross-departmental digital leadership is new.

Everyone (all depts) along for the journey - otherwise it'll just be another local stovepipe.

Highest common denominator.  Grew out of the MOD and security services. 

This is an engineering - make something activity - not a study something out of interest (that can happen too)

Make the basic foundation using the original agile manifesto-implied approach.

Foundation very small number of people - design, development, perfective.  Expect to draw on personnel who are specialist in certain areas.

Agile - benefits start from approximately day 1.  Expect this to take a couple of years.

Lots of parallel prototypical activities.  Concentrated and fast.

Start to accelerate and broaden.  Start to expand the number of people / companies with the necessary skills.  Ready the workforce. A foundation on its own is not really useful.  Start co-developing tools based on the foundation. Pj MICROCOSM. Also helps the foundation makers to have the feedback.

Open - at least about the foundations, not the use cases.  Start to improve the communication.  Anyone can take / use any bits at any time.

This phase is more technical.

## Phase 2a

Standard has stabilised. Foundation Maintenance.

Continue to Accelerate hard - tool making. 

Where to accelerate hard - political.

Crowd funding not competition.  Organisation becomes more of a coordination activity.

The desired end state is to have the processes and organisational structures in place to enable the UK to make, maintain and exploit world-leading digital standards and associated best practices. User needs are being efficiently and effectively collated and communicated to a strong high-tech academic and industrial base. The implications for new technical/computing developments are being recognised and exploited to generate best-of-class capabilities.


## Phase 2b

Don't forget how we got here.

Red team - starts again.

Start V2 straight away.  Don't ossify again.


## Timing

Don't get left behind.

This is coming anyway - nothing new here.
