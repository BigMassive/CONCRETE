# Provenance tracking and reproducibility

Don't get lost in your own information and data

Having many people and organisations working together in a collaborative environment, without support measures, would quickly generate a complex data and information mess.  People need to be able to accurately track how and where data or information was produced.  As our understanding of the world changes over time, people need to be able to re-visit previous assumptions.  People need to be able to track forwards from a now-questioned assumption to be able to understand the downstream effects it has had.  Equally people need to be able to track backwards to understand how a position was reached. 

The quality of the provenance tracking and reproducibility support within CONCRETE is important.  For example, in some cases this functionality will be used in the courts of law and public opinion to assess, with minimum doubt, whether people have acted appropriately and legally, or not.

IPFS as an immutable data store.

IOTA tangle provides history that would be particularly hard (essentially impossible) to modify.

Our golden-thread access-controls and .. give us the basis to enable fine-grained provenance tracking for everything as the norm.
