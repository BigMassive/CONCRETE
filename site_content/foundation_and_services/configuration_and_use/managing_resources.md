# Managing resources
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }


Finite supply, infinite demand, and some ethics 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
----

No matter how many processors, yottabytes of storage, or network bandwidth a system has, these resources will always be finite.  In today's world, where users are constrained within local stovepipes, access management and capacity is predominantly a local issue that will often go unnoticed. Removing those barriers will **inevitably** bring the question of resource allocation to the fore.  The only known approach to managing finite resources despite potential infinite demand in disparate groups is to adopt a **financial model**.    

<span>To-do</span>{: .label .label-blue} Genuinely, please test this. Try to identify a useful alternative.

In outline, in addition to any other mechanisms (described later), personnel would use digital finance tokens to 'pay' to make use of digital infrastructure such as processors, storage, and bandwidth anywhere within their network.  Supply and demand market pricing drives efficiency.  When used within an organisation, senior personnel would enact a powerful and flexible form of digital leadership by flowing digital funds, vouchers, or similar to the sub-organisations and personnel they want to achieve their strategic goals.  What is currently static, wasteful, and unresponsive would become dynamic and efficient.

Note that everyone understands money.

IOTA provides us with an excellent technical basis for any cryptocurrency-type approach; distributed ledgers are commonly used for this already (people might not have heard of IOTA, but they have probably heard of its sibling, Bitcoin.).

We have the technical basis to generate (almost?) any financial mechanisms.  but what tools do users need to maximise efficiency and effectiveness? 

## Lots of stuff to add

Description or link to how there can be multiple CONCRETE worlds living side-by-side.

Operational users where lives are at risk.

This definitely signals the potential benefits of, and provides the technical mechanism for, a digital GBP.  Minting.  Why - paying for stuff.

As at least some services (eg satellite bandwidth) might be external to an organisation. Odd things probably happen if an internal financial mechanism is misaligned with an external financial mechanism - could we generate loss-making loopholes?

This enables us get as close to 100% strategic effectiveness and efficiency at all times.

Security.  What do we mean by the cloud - somebody else's computer.  Given the security/risk mechanism here, this doesn't just mean big business - could hold data, conduct compute anywhere.

Peer-to-peer payments and the digital economy.

At a society level we currently see computing as free - actually advertising is paying for this. 

Home energy and heating by server project.

This is not anti-current-cloud.  There are definitely times when we will want all of our data/compute to be co-located in a single building.  We need this for compute efficiency.  What this is giving us though is choice.

Equally, we don't normally think of gov equipment this way - but it opens the possibility for gov to invest in digital infrastructure that it might need, and rent it out to others - of GFX it to collaborators etc.

Solves a major data issue. But tools for crowd support / sharing costs.

digital assets in an organisation are owned by the organisation.

Voucher vs financial mechanisms - military example - doesn't really make sense for an individual or sub-organisation to be able to accrue money over time.

1st class tickets,

Link with planning and markets, futures etc.

Enables us to define new financial-like mechanisms.  While the tokens themselves are like notes/coins, the presence of extra computing machinery allow us to define many new instruments.

Externalities - This server is the UK hooked up to the grid.  This other one is in a remote location running off a generator.  Who sets the prices and how?

Current prices as a signal for the need for extra capacity.

Given the expected ubiquitous use of this mechanism, this might drive in-silica trusted hardware requirements.

Potential - point to discuss? CONCRETE as gov-level best of class advice and service. Gov needs to do this anyway.  Using tax-payer's (our) money to develop and run this.  Can provide as a service to citizens and humanity. Risk management.  Enabling everyone to use best-of-class tools.  Could just have a stand-alone financial mechanism with current digital infra/devices, but users would risk nasty people running attacks on their wallets, hardware, etc.
