# Managing resources
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }


Finite supply, infinite demand, and some ethics 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
----

No matter how many processors, yottabytes of storage, or network bandwidth a system has, these resources will always be finite.  In today's world, where users are constrained within local stovepipes, access management and capacity is a predominantly a local issue that will often go unnoticed. Removing those barriers will **inevitably** bring the question of resource allocation to the fore.  The only known approach to managing finite resources despite potential infinite demand in disparate groups is to adopt a **financial model**.    

<span>To-do</span>{: .label .label-blue} Please test this.  Please try to identify a useful alternative.

In outline, in addition to any other mechanisms (described later), personnel would 'pay' to make use of digital infrastructure such as processors, storage, and bandwidth anywhere within their network.  Supply and demand market pricing drives efficiency.  Senior personnel within an organisation would enact a powerful and flexible form of digital leadership by flowing digital funds, vouchers, or similar to the sub-organisations and personnel they want to achieve their strategic goals.  What is currently static, would become dynamic.

IOTA provides us with an excellent technical basis for any cryptocurrency-type approach; distributed ledgers are commonly used for this already (eg Bitcoin).  The commercial side to IPFS already employs the pay-to-store / get-paid-to-store model (Filecoin). (As a reminder, we know that CONCRETE would seek to use something that is a refined amalgam of these tools - this is not a cryptocurrency investment opportunity; potentially the opposite.  Given the expected ubiquitous use of this mechanism, this might drive in-silica trusted hardware requirements).

<span>To-do</span>{: .label .label-blue} The main questions are not technical, but social: what types of financial mechanisms do users need to maximise efficiency and effectiveness?

There are many observations to implications.


## Ethical exceptions

Operational users where lives are at risk.

## National and global economy

This is the first time...





 This enables them to flexibly should be seeking to get as close to 100% strategic effectiveness and efficiency at all times.

This payment model is already used in cloud computing (hiring other people's computing infrastructure on demand - often referred to as 'elastic-compute').  



digital assets in an organisation are owned by the organisation.




 As at least some services (eg satellite bandwidth) 

Solves a major data issue.



Introduction of new digital financial instruments opens up many possibilities.
