Configuring the CONCRETE stack to enable our socio-technical needs 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
----

The CONCRETE stack gives us some necessary and powerful tools, but these are just a developmental starting point. This section explores how these tools could be configured to enable the rest of our user needs. 

The picture painted by the CONCRETE stack alone is almost a blank canvas (too blank).  With unlocked permissions anyone could anything with anyone, at any time, anywhere.  While there would be no technical barriers to cooperation and teamwork, such a system would be unusable; we would have a digital version of anarchy. Some additional structure is needed.   

The following pages describe additional mechanisms to enable users to manage security, risk, and access to digital resources. While unlocking access to huge amounts of data and information will be incredibly powerful, in a dynamic world, users would quickly get lost in the mayhem; further tools to enable provenance tracking and reproducibility are added.

<span>To-do</span>{: .label .label-blue} The socio-technical drivers discussed here currently focus on groups of people at the scale of medium-to-large companies and government departments. This work needs to be extended to include groups with different sizes and different personas. The CONCRETE foundation needs to be able support groups that grow and shrink in size from an individual to an entire society.  This is discussed at greater length LINK-here.
