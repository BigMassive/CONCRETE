No such thing as perfect security - this means that we inevitably have to develop an approach that includes pros and cons.

Hence we really end up talking about risk and trust.


The majority of the CONCRETE stack is related to security and risk in some way. 
Secure-by-design.


Rather than exploring all potential security possibilities.  This section
Describes the 'as envisaged' approach to configuring and using the CONCRETE stack to enable user needs.  Benefits risks and limits.  As an open work-in-progress, spears are always welcome.



Making use of the underlying capability system from seL4.

data and information security.

We will find that risk awareness, management, and trust come to the fore.

Physical - Not everything is about digital - but can still support digital aspects of it.

Personas - king, boss, - organisational level.  Alice, Bob, and friends.  Guards and who guards the guards?




Capability system - formally proven operating system.
IOTA - capability tokens.
Trusted hardware




Information security

What do we mean by information security?

Information - Need to know. This is entirely socio- , we just want to be helped by our digital.

red, yellow, white paper, manifold combination locks, keys etc.  These are just tools.  With digital we get some new tools.



Data security

Data storage - narrowest possible.

potential information content.



Trust boundaries
From small beginnings - group trust dynamics.



Risk and interfaces
Risk, resilience and redundancy.
Chaos engineering
Not enough that we could react - we need to do the right thing on the night. Training, confidence.
Zeroise


Distributed, decentralised, layered approaches to enable physical aspects to security.
identity, dongles and location.


Ouroboros.  Trust in the network stack. Networking in general - Physical space / distance makes control much harder/impossible.  Things are outside my sphere of influence and control.

Spacetime management.
