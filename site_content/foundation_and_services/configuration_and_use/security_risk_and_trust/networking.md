Maybe this should be data movement and networking?


Marker - Probably - not definitely - more work required to fit this in.

Ouroboros
Is not just about security.

Reducing the attack surface. Get away from the cottage industry associated with TCP/IP.

Reasoning.

Quality of Service

Still won't be perfect.

Still (always) need to deal with probabilities.

Reflected into user-space
Ie we should understand the implications of the probabilities.

Need for users - to influence / describe routing patterns - to security/risk associated with network links and nodes.



Naming and identity - link to the process - and that process is now identified within the CONCRETE access-control approach - hence golden thread across the distributed decentralised landscape.
