Need-to-know management in the digital age 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
----

The primary purpose of information security is to maintain a **need-to-know** boundary: who's in? and who's out? These in/out decisions are made by people, and change over time.  The need is entirely socio-, the enabling support is -technical. In the paper-age in UK government departments (mirrored by most other countries and many organisations) the best -technical support that could be mustered was to use markings such as SECRET and TOP-SECRET, different colored paper, handling processes, training, and locked cabinets.  Digital technologies can be used to generate support that is simultaneously far more effective and simpler for users.

In socio-technical outline, every piece of information (as defined by users) is individually supplemented with meta-data that includes (amongst other things) data about who is permitted to access that material. The material is cryptographically locked from anyone who does not meet that criteria.  Additional, arbitrarily complex and restrictive access control measures can further limit access by users eg by location.

There are various other socio-technical aspects and details:

## Multi-level security

For people steeped in stratified classification approaches (eg OFFICIAL and SECRET), all of those badges remain, they largely represent broad-brush impact statements (eg if this material was known to people in the 'out' group, this could have national-level consequences).  The approach described here allows all information to be kept in a single environment - sometimes referred to as multi-level security.  The 'levels' of 'multi-level' reflect old paper-age approaches that were largely just signals to personnel to aid with handling processes.  They did not, themselves, bar personnel from access, they were ink on a page. They should not be confused with what users really need ie to manage actual need-to-know. In this approach, the underlying computing system is being used to track of those details and actually enforce access control directly.

For those people used to having entirely separate computing devices for stratified security classified material, project CONCRETE, in collaboration with many groups involved in those earlier approaches, is defining new standards to be used universally, that meet or surpass anything, at any level, currently in use.   

## Github - A mental-image short-cut

Many people with a technical background will be familiar with git and github - these can act as a mental short-cut here.  For those people who are not familiar and are interested, the front-page Readme section of this website provides something of a guided tour.

LINK back to github.

Description in terms of github.

Difference here is that github is a centralised server.  What's going to happen is that we're going to join the server-side data with the data itself.

Which then gets us to names.

IOTA to track head.

## Other meta-data

Write permissions / authoring hierarchy.

Impact statements.  If X knew this then Y.  Can come from anyone.

Doorbell mechanism

Associated issues / discussions threads

Automations

All under git-like version control.

Why git (version control) has been transformative in software teams.

Why the issues discussions are important - we can see the nuance behind the current state.

We tend to think of this as being for text - this isn't the only thing.

Look and feel.  Live, ongoing.  Can refer to a particular version.

Discuss people both coming and going from access lists as information / risk changes eg the personnel report example.

Discuss the implication of the version control approach.

## Same subject different need-to-know properties

Describe general technical approach to this.

## Link with wider system

Dongles, personnel tracking etc

Reading people in.

Actually tracking who knew at which point rather than it all being rumours.

Won't totally stop this, but make it much easier for users.

Auto-obscuring screens etc when somebody who doesn't need to know visits.




Step back here and we see that we're putting the users themselves at the heart of this - this is socio- enabled by technical.
