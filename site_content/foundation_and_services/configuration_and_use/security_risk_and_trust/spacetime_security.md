Clock synchronisation is important

As highlighted, greater clock accuracy brings greater capability.  

The reverse is also true - mess with clocks can mess with us.

HQDM as a 4D ontology. Timing of events alters our perception of the world.

It itself needs to be protected.

From the foundation, IOTA works as a crude clock.

Clocks in the more traditional sense.

Beyond NTP and GPS.

Get ready for this:

Timelords and user-space

Dynamically affecting capability of others.
Automation and consent.

Again, the coherent layered approach to security should enable this.

Might tell us something about physical networking end points.

Don't necessarily want fibre for time and fibre for data.
