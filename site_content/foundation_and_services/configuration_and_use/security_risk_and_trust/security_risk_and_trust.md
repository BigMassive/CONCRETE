There is no such thing as 'perfect' security; humans are involved.  This means that we inevitably have to develop security approaches that have pros and cons. We are led, by necessity, to talk in terms of risk and trust.

The vast majority of the CONCRETE stack is related to security and risk in some way. Rather than exploring all potential security possibilities, this section describes the current 'as envisaged' approach to configuring and using the CONCRETE stack to enable user needs.  Known risks and limits are highlighted. As an open work-in-progress activity, the request to readers is to remain alert and critical; well-aimed spears are the most valuable commodity in security-related developments.

The following pages start by examining access control measures, before describing approaches to information, and data security.  As expected, we find that risk awareness, management, and trust come to the fore. Support for human-scale physical security functionality is then discussed before venturing into the realms of networking, and spacetime security.   

<span>To-do</span>{: .label .label-blue} The next pages discuss the tools and processes necessary to enable groups sizes of medium-scale companies to large organisations. Although the CONCRETE stack is expected to be powerful enough to support group sizes from individuals to societies, the implications for associated tool and process requirements have yet to be worked through in detail.  It is important that this happens. 

When discussing organisations, we use our familiar friends Alice and Bob.  Given the UK government department origins, we include roles such as King, guards, users, and bosses (users will often have have multiple boss-characters in their lives).  When considering other group contexts we can substitute someone like CEO for King.


<span> Probable </span>{: .label .label-purple} This is one of the more dynamic parts of project CONCRETE - expect some change.
