# Physical security and identity

Enabling human-scale physical security

Forget any cyber-voodoo, all computing is physical.
Distributed, decentralised, layered approaches to enable physical aspects to security.
identity, dongles and location.

Lot of weight being held by the identity system - keeping a single number secret.

We can do something about that.


Everything is physical.

A hostile actor could mess with our device and do nasty things.

There are various inter-related or layered ways that we can help ourselves.


Run processes in the background to check if something is still plugged in and working - it would be hard to de-cap a chip while it's on.

Why layered - don't want a central point of failure, security in depth.
