# Physical security and identity
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }


Improving human-scale physical security
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
----


Scale of transistors - not got beyond the computers.  But these live in a wider human context.

Stovepipes - security system and the systems that users normally work with.

Building access, etc is something separate.

In considering how this might work in a CONCRETE world - we find

Nothing new about Security in distributed, decentralised depth, but there are

Some things here about concrete foundation, and 
mutually supportive opportunities

others about using it to better user-experience effect.

## Strength in depth.
No such thing as perfect security.

Not one-size-fits-all

The level of security should be fit for purpose - this is about the tools.

The role of Probability 


## Human Identity

The CONCRETE access-control, data, and information security approaches are primarily based on cryptographic techniques. These act as mathematical locks and keys (they are commonly long strings of numbers). It's doing a lot of security heavy lifting - loss of these numbers could allow bad things to happen.
These are great, but those keys have to be stored somewhere (physical). People will lose them.

Use of pseudonyms help with this.

Identity services.  

Dongles.  Something I own - identity.  Which in turn can start to add more functionality for the management of need-to-know.

Separate gait identification. Biometric face recognition.... 

Tracking people.

Biometrics

Not just for access to CONCRETE but Physical access to a building.

Looks like me, that walks like me, that turned up in my car - and that no other systems are tracking.



## Improved security experience

Given better human identity

Using the system to help users to add people to information access lists.

Using the system to obscure screens while somebody else could see a screen.





## Component identity

We have to be careful about nasty people circumventing our digital security mechanisms by somehow modifying, or just stealing, our trusted hardware. 

Supply chain.

Identity itself.

Trusted hardware - identity and to understand the level of risk that it has been tampered with.

Run processes in the background to check if something is still plugged in and working - it would be hard to de-cap anyway, but even harder while it's on.  It's harder still if there's a camera monitoring the space that it's in.
