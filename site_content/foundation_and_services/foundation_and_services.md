# Foundation and Services
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

This is an engineering work-in-progress section that seeks to define and describe a new foundation and any associated services. The foundation is socio-technical: it describes a new technical approach to configuring digital machinery; the socio- aspect simultaneously drives the design of the technical system (What do we all need?), and tells us what this means from a user perspective (How will we use it?). This new foundation will, in turn, generate the need for new digital services: groups of people with new, or modified, supporting roles and responsibilities.

On a day-to-day basis users will work with tools built on these foundations, not with the foundations themselves.  The foundation enables these tools by providing a single standardised approach to concepts such as security, data, and resource management.  The foundation needs to be as simple as possible, but no simpler.  Wherever there is choice, this is left to the toolmakers.

This section starts by describing just [three basic user needs]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/basic_needs.md %}).  These are enough to substantially limit the technical design space. We then jump straight to the main outline technical 'stack' sketch. There is introductory material about the building blocks. We then use that technical sketch as the basis to develop much more socio-technical detail. This is still far from a complete technical description, there is a dedicated area for the most speculative parts of the cutting-edge. Having intermixed socio- with a lot of -technical, a dedicated user perspective provides a summary-style overview; a first day at your new work walk-through.
