# Foundation and Services
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

This is an engineering work-in-progress section that seeks to define and describe a new foundation and any associated services. The foundation is socio-technical: it describes a new technical approach to configuring digital machinery; the socio- aspect simultaneously drives the design of the technical system (What do we all need?), and tells us what this means from a user perspective (How will we use it?). This new foundation will, in turn, generate the need for new digital services: groups of people with new, or modified, supporting roles and responsibilities.



On a day-to-day basis users will work with tools built on these foundations, not with the foundations themselves.  The foundation enables these tools by providing a single standardised approach to concepts such as security, data, and resource management.  The foundation needs to be as simple as possible, but no simpler.  Wherever there is choice, this is left to the toolmakers.

This section starts by describing just [four basic user needs]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/some_basic_needs.md %}).  These are enough to substantially limit the technical design space. This allows us to jump straight to the main outline [technical 'stack']({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/the_concrete_stack/the_concrete_stack.md %}) sketch (including introductory material about all the components). We then add some much-needed [configuration]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/configuration_and_use/configuration_and_use.md %}) of the bare-bones stack to provide mechanisms for concepts such as security, risk, and resource management. With most of the broad brush picture in place, there is some material dedicated to the highly-developmental [cutting-edge]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/cutting_edge/cutting_edge.md %}). Before, finally, after lots of socio-technical detail, we zoom back out to provide ourselves with some different [user perspectives]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/user_perspectives/user_perspectives.md %}) of living and working in a CONCRETE world.
