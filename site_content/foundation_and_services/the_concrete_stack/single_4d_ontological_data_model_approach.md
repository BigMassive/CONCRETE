# Single 4D Ontological Data Model Approach
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }


Being clear about what data 'means' is crucial

Raw digital data is just numbers (or physical patches of magnetism, or charges, or similar that represent numbers). Data requires some kind of context to capture what it 'means'. In day-to-day life we might casually tabulate data with headings.

| Date      | Outside temperature at 1200 |
|:----------|:----------------------------|
| 27 Jan 83 | 12                          |
| 28 Jan 83 | 15                          |

This table might be absolutely fine locally, but it lacks a great deal if we tried to share it.  Somebody receiving this table might have a lot of questions (including, but certainly not restricted to):  

- 1200 local, or GMT, or .. ? 
- Degrees F, or C, or Kelvin, or .. ?
- 1983, or 1883, or .. ?
- Where ?
- As measured by what ?

An ontology is the most powerful technical approach yet devised to enable people to accurately, and flexibly, capture these 'meanings'.  This do not force people to add this kind of context (although it is good), but it does allow people to be arbitrarily precise with what they mean.  Without this, data (eg the number 4) can be literally meaningless.

Ontologies sit at the top of the family of 'technologies' that include dictionaries and taxonomies. Many current attempts at digital/data interoperability involve these less powerful devices.  They often use a type of form-filling (or data formatting) where the meaning of a data entry has been pre-agreed or standardised by a group or committee. Ontologies are far more powerful. They are the ultimate tools for data quality and interoperability.  4-dimensional (4D) ontologies are, within this, the most powerful and useful; they provide a uniformly consistent representation of anything that is actually or possibly 'real' in 4D spacetime (including possible futures).[^survey]
