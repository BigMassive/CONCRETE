# Human Machine Interface Best Practice

A coherent approach to human-centric systems

----

Current digital stovepipes each have their own human machine interface approaches.  When CONCRETE removes those technical barriers, it will become increasingly important to have a coherent approach to HMI.  Users do not want every development to come with its own unique interface approach.

Within CONCRETE itself, for example, it will be important for security to ensure that users' views of potential risks are largely coherent. Risk visualisations etc should conform to common standards (to simplify the mental workload, and the help users to make apples-to-apples comparisons).  The same will be true across many domains.

This does not mean that users should be forced to adopt specific interfaces; different users will respond to different interfaces in different ways.  This is just to drive towards coherence between families of interface components.
