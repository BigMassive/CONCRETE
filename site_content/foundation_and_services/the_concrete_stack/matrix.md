Matrix is about secure decentralised human communication channels  

<span>Probable</span>{: .label .label-purple } While users will need matrix-style communications methods, and [matrix] was specifically designed with decentralised human communication in mind, the underlying protocol has yet to be analysed sufficiently to claim that this is stable. This is not a reflection on [matrix], just an observation about the maturity of CONCRETE.

E2E encryption is generally secure, the end point hosts or central servers are attacked.
