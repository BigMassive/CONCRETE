Governments should provide digital infrastructure, tools, and services beyond the common current offerings of networks and web-based applications. This project primarily explores this potential future with practical questions of What and Why and When and How and Where and Who. Although Project CONCRETE seeks to create an uncompromising vision for an ideal digital world, this is not creative science-fiction; it is also a map for the journey grounded in socio-technical reality.  The vision is limited to observations that have a So-what.

The expectation is that any such infrastructure components and opportunities would live alongside the current digital landscape. People, companies, and organisations would be entirely free to use both. The suggestion is that the implications of doing so could radically improve society.  However, this is work-in-progress.  The first invitation is to come to your own conclusions, and to request criticism. There are errors and mistakes here; please point them out in the Issues area at this link:

Rather than talking in abstract terms, this project uses the UK and associated government departments for context and examples (in doing so, it talks about, but not for, the UK Government).

This is a collection of material for many people with different needs.  It is not necessarily meant to be consumed linearly.  However, it starts with some generic observations from the UK Ministry Of Defence (MOD).  This helps to establish an initial outline set of demanding socio-technical needs that are expected to be universally applicable. (Resilience, redundancy, risk/reward, ethics, management of finite resources, ..)

We then provide a preliminary technical sketch of a foundation system that can enable those needs.  It is surprisingly simple, and already being prototyped.  Later sections provide zero-to-hero style material about the technical sub-components in this sketch (no prior knowledge is assumed, much of this material may be new for technologists too).  This sketch is then used as the basis for a fuller discussion about how these technical underpinnings could be used in day-to-day life. (Data access management, security, ..)

As a work-in-progress there are many places where it is important to highlight where work is required and/or to highlight the current degree of certainty in an approach.  The following labels are used to portray this:

To-do
{: .label .label-blue }

Stable
{: .label .label-green }

Probable
{: .label .label-purple }

Potential
{: .label .label-yellow }

Highly Speculative
{: .label .label-red }

Separated from questions about the socio-technical Whys and What, there is also a section for material associated with How, Who, and When. Project CONCRETE-style developments are expected to become a continuous process of development and delivery.  How might decisions and developments be organised?  Included here are elements about associated internal government decision-making, potential national and international consequences, departmental roles/opportunities, and developments associated with industrial strategy (sometimes referred to as sub-project MICROCOSM).
